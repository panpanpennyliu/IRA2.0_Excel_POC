1. Find the same type of action and action id required to implement PROPOSE based on the state_transition_caption in the knowledge base. If you cannot find a required action in the knowledge base, you need to name the required action, and the value of action id is "waiting to be added".

2. Ensure that the order of actions is correct. The action chain must be generated strictly in the order specified by the user. The order of each action is represented by action_index, counting from 1.

3. If the action is "LEFT_CLICK", "click_Element" is also returned, and its value is the name of the element clicked by the mouse.
If the action contains "KEY", "key_code" is also returned, and its value is the value required in PURPOSE.

4. Return actions in the following json format
    {

If the required action_type is in the knowledge base, and the required click_Element and the knowledge base are of the same type, they can be regarded as actions with the same id.
If there is no same action_type or similar click_Element, you need to name the action_type, and the id is "waiting added"

If the action contains "KEY", "key_code" is also returned, and its value is the value required in PURPOSE.

3. Ensure that the order of actions is correct. The action chain must be generated strictly in the order specified by the user. The order of each action is represented by action_index, counting from 1.

1. Based on the state_transition_caption attribute in the knowledge base, find the same type of action and its action ID required to implement PROPOSE. 
In Excel, click_Element has the following types: buttons with text, cells, and text boxes that can be entered except cells
If the required action_type is in the knowledge base, and this action_type does not contain "CLICK", it can be regarded as an action with the same id. 
If thi required action_type contain "CLICK", and the required click_Element and the knowledge base are of the same type, it can be regarded as an action with the same id.

Based on the information in the knowledge base, describe how to implement PURPOSE in the interface shown in the picture.

1. Based on the state_transition_caption attribute in the knowledge base, find the same type of action and its action ID required to implement PROPOSE. 
In Excel, click_Element has the following types: buttons with text, cells, and text boxes that can be entered except cells
If the required action_type is in the knowledge base, and this action_type does not contain "CLICK", it can be regarded as an action with the same id. 
If thi required action_type contain "CLICK", and the required click_Element and the knowledge base are of the same type, it can be regarded as an action with the same id.
If there is no same action_type or similar click_Element, you need to name the action_type, and the id is "unknow"

2. If the action is "LEFT_CLICK", "click_Element" is also returned, and its value is the element name clicked by the mouse.
If the action contains "KEY", "key_code" is also returned, and its value is the value required in PURPOSE.

3. Ensure that the order of actions is correct. The action chain must be generated strictly in the order specified by the user. The order of each action is represented by action_index, counting from 1.

4. Return actions in the following json format

Based on the information in the knowledge base, describe how to implement PURPOSE in the interface shown in the picture.

1. Based on the state_transition_caption attribute in the knowledge base, find the same type of action and its action ID required to implement PROPOSE. 
In Excel, click_Element has the following types: buttons with text, cells, and text boxes that can be entered except cells
If the required action_type is in the knowledge base, and this action_type does not contain "CLICK", it can be regarded as an action with the same id. 
If the required action_type contain "CLICK", and the required click_Element and the knowledge base are of the same type, it can be regarded as an action with the same id.
If there is no same action_type or similar click_Element, the action_type and id is "unknow"

2. If the action is "LEFT_CLICK", "click_Element" is also returned, and its value is the element name clicked by the mouse.
If the action contains "KEY", "key_code" is also returned, and its value is the value required in PURPOSE.

3. Ensure that the order of actions is correct. The action chain must be generated strictly in the order specified by the user. The order of each action is represented by action_index, counting from 1.

4. Return actions in the following json format
    {
        "actions": [
            {
            "action_index":"",
            "action_type": "",

 To find the center of "Sheet1," we need to determine its position and size within the image. "Sheet1" is located at the bottom left of the image, where the tabs are.

Assuming the tab is a small rectangle, let's estimate its center:

- The width of the image is 2240 pixels.
- The height of the image is 1400 pixels.

The "Sheet1" tab is likely around the bottom left corner. Let's assume its approximate center is at:

- **x**: 100 (a rough estimate for the horizontal position)
- **y**: 1350 (a rough estimate for the vertical position)

So, the coordinates for the center of "Sheet1" are approximately:

 To find the center of "Sheet1," we need to determine the coordinates of the center of the tab labeled "Sheet1" at the bottom of the image.

Assuming the tab is approximately centered horizontally and vertically within its section, you can estimate the center coordinates based on the visible layout. However, without precise measurements, this will be an approximation.

Let's assume the tab is roughly 100 pixels wide and 30 pixels tall, and it's located near the bottom left of the image. If the tab starts around (100, 1300), the center would be approximately:

- **x**: 100 + 50 = 150
- **y**: 1300 + 15 = 1315

So, the approximate center coordinates of "Sheet1" are:

```json

    "y": "1315"
}

 Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Identify the "red X":** The "red X" likely refers to the red "X" icon on the taskbar, which is the icon for the Visual Studio Code application.
2.  **Check if it's inside Sheet1:** The taskbar is outside the Excel window, and therefore not inside Sheet1.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action MUST be limited to the following types: KEY_PRESS, LEFT_CLICK, RIGHT_CLICK, DOUBLE_CLICK, SCROLL, HOTKEY.
Action example:
<No>: <ACTION>-<Description of action>
1: LEFT_CLICK - Left click the G15 cell in Sheet2.
2: KEY_PRESS - Enter '2' in cell G15 from keyboard.
3: HOTKEY - Save the excel file, enter ctrl+s from keyboard.

```json
{
	"ExceptionDescription": string  // Description of the exception
	"ActionDescription": string  // Description of the action

2: KEY_PRESS - Enter '2' in cell G15 from keyboard.
3: SWITCH - Switch window to application.
