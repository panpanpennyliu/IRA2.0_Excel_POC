Based on the information in the knowledge base, describe how to implement PURPOSE in the interface shown in the picture.

1. Based on the state_transition_caption attribute in the knowledge base, find the same type of action and its action ID required to implement PROPOSE. 
In Excel, click_Element has the following types: buttons with text, cells, and text boxes that can be entered except cells
If the required action_type is in the knowledge base, and this action_type does not contain "CLICK", it can be regarded as an action with the same id. 
If the required action_type contain "CLICK", and the required click_Element and the knowledge base are of the same type, it can be regarded as an action with the same id.
If there is no same action_type or similar click_Element, the action_type and id is "unknow"

2. If the action is "LEFT_CLICK", "click_Element" and "click_Element_type" are returned at the same time, and their values are the element name and element type of the mouse click.
If the action contains "KEY", "key_code" is also returned, and its value is the value required in PURPOSE.

3. Ensure that the order of actions is correct. The action chain must be generated strictly in the order specified by the user. The order of each action is represented by action_index, counting from 1.
